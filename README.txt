When using localhost, certain browsers will not allow saving cookies.  We've found it works on Edge but not with Google Chrome.  Alternatively, while running the site off replit does not allow the SQL database to be accessed, the cookies will work.

You can create a new user, or use some sample accounts with some sample events:

John Doe:
Username: user1
Password: password1

Jane Doe:
Username: user2
Password: password2

Bob Smith:
Username: user3
Password: password3
